# Code Refactoring and Cleanup

You will perform systematic code refactoring and cleanup while maintaining functionality using the Subagent Context Engineering Workflow approach.

## Usage
```
/refactor-clean "[target-area]"
```

Example target areas:
- `"authentication system"` - Focus on auth-related code
- `"database layer"` - Clean up data access and models
- `"user interface components"` - Refactor UI components
- `"api endpoints"` - Clean up backend API code
- `"utility functions"` - Organize helper functions
- `"entire codebase"` - Comprehensive cleanup

## Refactoring Philosophy

**Refactor to improve without breaking.** Every change should make the code more maintainable, readable, or performant while preserving existing functionality. Clean code is easier to test, debug, and extend.

## Core Refactoring Principles

1. **Preserve Functionality**: Maintain exact behavioral compatibility
2. **Improve Incrementally**: Small, focused changes over large rewrites
3. **Test Continuously**: Verify functionality after each change
4. **Document Changes**: Track what was changed and why
5. **Safety First**: Always have rollback procedures ready

## Step-by-Step Refactoring Process

### Step 1: Target Analysis and Scope Definition
```
task "Analyze refactoring target and define scope" architect

Instructions for architect:
1. Review the specified target area code structure
2. Identify specific refactoring opportunities:
   - Code duplication and repetition
   - Complex functions that should be broken down
   - Unclear variable/function names
   - Inconsistent patterns and conventions
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Security vulnerabilities
3. Assess refactoring complexity and time requirements
4. Define clear scope boundaries to prevent scope creep
5. Identify potential risks and breaking changes
6. Create refactoring priority matrix (high impact, low risk first)
```

### Step 2: Pre-Refactoring Safety Setup
Before any changes, establish safety measures:

```bash
# Create backup branch
git checkout -b backup/pre-refactor-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
git push -u origin backup/pre-refactor-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Return to main branch and create refactoring branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b refactor/[target-area]-cleanup

# Ensure all tests pass before refactoring
npm test || yarn test || python -m pytest

# Document current state
git add -A
git commit -m "Pre-refactor checkpoint: Clean baseline

Instructions for context-keeper:
1. Update current-state.md with refactoring improvements
2. Document any architectural changes made
3. Note any technical debt resolved
4. Record any new patterns or conventions established
5. Update code quality metrics if available
6. Flag any areas still needing future refactoring
```

**Remember**: Refactoring is about improving the internal structure of code without changing its external behavior. Focus on making the code more maintainable, readable, and efficient while ensuring functionality remains intact. Always measure twice, cut once - thorough analysis and testing prevent breaking changes.
