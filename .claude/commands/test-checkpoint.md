# Human Testing Checkpoint Coordination

You will coordinate comprehensive human testing at development checkpoints using the Subagent Context Engineering Workflow approach.

## Usage
```
/test-checkpoint
```

## Process Overview

This command orchestrates human testing coordination at natural breakpoints in the development workflow. It generates comprehensive test scenarios, sets up testing environments, processes human feedback, and creates actionable improvement tasks to maintain quality throughout the development cycle.

## Testing Philosophy

1. **Human-Centric Validation**: AI builds features, humans verify they work correctly
2. **Early and Frequent Testing**: Test at natural checkpoints before issues compound
3. **Comprehensive Scenario Coverage**: Test happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions
4. **Accessibility-First Approach**: Ensure features work for all users from the start
5. **Actionable Feedback Processing**: Convert testing results into specific improvement tasks

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Checkpoint Readiness Assessment
```
task "Analyze development status and checkpoint readiness" test-coordinator

Instructions for test-coordinator:
1. Review current-state.md for completed features since last checkpoint
2. Assess scope and complexity of changes ready for testing
3. Identify integration points with existing functionality
4. Check for any known limitations or temporary workarounds
5. Determine if features are in testable state
6. Validate that development environment can be easily started
```

### Step 2: Test Scenario Generation
```
task "Generate comprehensive test scenarios for all ready features" test-coordinator

Instructions for test-coordinator:
1. Create detailed test scenarios covering:
   - Primary user workflows (happy path)
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Error handling and validation
   - Accessibility and keyboard navigation
   - Cross-browser compatibility considerations
   - Performance and responsiveness
2. Generate step-by-step testing instructions
3. Define clear success criteria for each scenario
4. Include both functional and non-functional testing
5. Prepare accessibility-specific test cases
6. Create realistic test data and user scenarios
```

### Step 3: Testing Environment Setup
```
task "Prepare testing environment and documentation" test-coordinator

Instructions for test-coordinator:
1. Verify application startup process works smoothly
2. Document any special setup requirements or dependencies
3. Prepare test data, user accounts, or sample content as needed
4. Create clear startup and navigation instructions
5. Test environment setup on clean machine perspective
6. Ensure all necessary development servers/services are documented
7. Prepare troubleshooting guide for common setup issues
```

### Step 4: Test Guide Creation and Presentation
