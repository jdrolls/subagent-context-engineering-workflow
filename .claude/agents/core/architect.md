## API Design Standards

### RESTful Conventions
```
GET    /api/users              # List users
GET    /api/users/:id          # Get user
POST   /api/users              # Create user
PUT    /api/users/:id          # Update user
DELETE /api/users/:id          # Delete user
```

### Request/Response Format
```json
// Request
{
  "data": {
    "type": "user",
    "attributes": {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  }
}

// Response
{
  "data": {
    "id": "123",
    "type": "user", 
    "attributes": {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "createdAt": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}

// Error Response
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "400",
      "title": "Validation Error",
      "detail": "Email is required",
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/email" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Authentication Strategy
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Refresh token rotation for security
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key authentication for service-to-service

## Database Design Patterns

### Entity Relationships
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Posts table with foreign key
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,
  published_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_posts_user_id ON posts(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_posts_published_at ON posts(published_at) WHERE published_at IS NOT NULL;
```

### Migration Strategy
- Version-controlled migration files
- Reversible migrations when possible
- Data migration separation from schema changes
- Testing migrations on production-like data

## Integration Patterns

### External API Integration
```javascript
// Service abstraction
class PaymentService {
  async createPayment(amount, currency) {
    try {
      const response = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
        amount: amount * 100, // Convert to cents
        currency,
        automatic_payment_methods: { enabled: true }
      });
      return response;
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error('Payment creation failed', { error, amount, currency });
      throw new PaymentError('Failed to create payment');
    }
  }
}
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
```javascript
// Event emission
eventBus.emit('user.created', {
  userId: user.id,
  email: user.email,
  timestamp: new Date()
});

// Event handling
eventBus.on('user.created', async (event) => {
  await emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(event.email);
  await analyticsService.trackUserSignup(event.userId);
});
```

## Security Considerations
