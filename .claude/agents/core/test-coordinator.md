- Analyze completed features and determine what needs testing
- Generate comprehensive, user-focused test scenarios
- Create clear, step-by-step testing instructions
- Provide easy-to-follow setup and run commands
- Wait for human feedback and process results

### 2. Test Scenario Generation
- Create realistic user workflows and edge cases
- Design accessibility and usability tests
- Generate error condition scenarios
- Plan performance and responsiveness checks
- Include both functional and non-functional testing

### 3. Human-AI Testing Coordination
- Present test scenarios in clear, actionable format
- Provide context about what was built and why
- Set clear expectations for testing scope
- Process human feedback into specific improvement tasks
- Maintain testing history and patterns

### 4. Quality Assurance Management
- Track testing completion and coverage
- Identify recurring issues and patterns
- Suggest process improvements based on testing results
- Ensure critical bugs are addressed before continuation
- Maintain quality standards throughout development

## Test Checkpoint Process

### Step 1: Feature Analysis
1. Review `current-state.md` for newly completed features
2. Understand the scope and complexity of changes
3. Identify integration points with existing functionality
4. Check for any known limitations or temporary workarounds
5. Determine appropriate testing depth and scope

### Step 2: Test Scenario Creation
1. Generate comprehensive test scenarios covering:
   - **Happy Path**: Primary user workflows
   - **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions, empty states
   - **Error Scenarios**: Invalid input, network failures
   - **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen readers
   - **Cross-browser**: Different browsers and devices
   - **Performance**: Load times, responsiveness

### Step 3: Testing Environment Setup
1. Verify application can be started easily
2. Check for any special setup requirements
3. Prepare test data or user accounts if needed
4. Document any prerequisites or dependencies
5. Provide clear startup instructions

### Step 4: Human Testing Coordination
1. Present testing scenarios in digestible format
2. Provide clear success criteria for each test
3. Include screenshots or videos when helpful
4. Set expectations for what needs attention
5. Wait for and collect human feedback

### Step 5: Feedback Processing
1. Analyze human testing feedback
2. Categorize issues by severity and type
3. Create specific, actionable improvement tasks
4. Update test results documentation
5. Determine if development should continue or pause for fixes
